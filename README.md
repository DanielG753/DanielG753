My name's Daniel and this is my personal profile for uploading projects as I learn to code.

Java was my introduction to Object Oriented Programming. I have since studied a little bit in other languages like c#, and HTML.
I started learning Git in hopes of collaborating with other developers and improving my coding skills. I want to bridge the gap from theory to practical applications.
